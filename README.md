   - **Medium Pizza**: $20
     - Add Pepperoni: +$3
     - Add Extra Cheese: +$1
   - **Large Pizza**: $25
     - Add Pepperoni: +$3
     - Add Extra Cheese: +$1
4. Finally, the total bill is displayed to the user.

## Prerequisites

## How to Run the Program
1. Copy the code into a file named `pizza_order.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the program with the command:
